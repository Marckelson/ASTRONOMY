# ASTRONOMY
The "Astronomy" GitHub repository contains a collection of code developed during my PhD, designed to assist researchers working with astronomy data, particularly focusing on aspects such as line emission and absorption. 

This repository aims to streamline the research process for astronomers by providing specific codes and functions tailored to their data analysis needs. Whether you are studying spectral lines or investigating absorbers in the universe, this toolkit aims to simplify your workflow and enhance the efficiency of your research in the field of astronomy. 

Contributions and modifications are encouraged, fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvement and innovation.
